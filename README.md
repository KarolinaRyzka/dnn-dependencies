## About

This project aims to identify DNN dependencies within PTMs. In other words, we
aim to identify and measure similarity between two PTMs without reviewing their
source code.

### Dataset Utilized

To conduct our research, we utilized the PTMTorrent Dataset. For more
information about the dataset, as well as instructions on how to download and
access it, please see this link.
